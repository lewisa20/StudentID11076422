# List of Excel Files

- Model_Inputs_Outputs_Set_1.xlsx
  - Set 1 of Inputs/Outputs for statistical model
  - The spreadsheet gives all imputs to the performance against CAF for base cases and high/low resilience modelled companies. The mean and standard deviation outputs from the model are used in the relevent MATLAB scripts to generate fragility curves.
- Model_Inputs_Outputs_Set_2_Adjusted.xlsx
  - Set 2 of Inputs/Outputs for statistical model
  - Statistical model inputs/outputs with low resilience company performing worse against CAF than in set 1.
