# Adam Lewis 3rd Year Individual Project

Repository for documents and code.

- MATLAB scripts created using R2024b, Update 2, version 24.2.0.27731420
- Spreadsheet files created using Microsoft 365 Excel

# List of MATLAB Scripts

- script 1
- script 2

# List of Excel Files

- first spreadsheet
  - Set 1 of Inputs/Outputs for statistical model
  - The spreadsheet gives all imputs to the performance against CAF for base cases and high/low resilience modelled companies. The mean and standard deviation outputs from the model are used in the relevent MATLAB scripts to generate fragility curves.
- second spreadsheet
  - Set 2 of Inputs/Outputs for statistical model
  - Statistical model inputs/outputs with low resilience company performing worse against CAF than in set 1.
